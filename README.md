# Bill Holt

Senior Product Manager — Platform (APIs & Integrations) | Multi-tenant SaaS | “ship means stable”

**What I do**
- Own API/integration workflows end-to-end: discovery → mapping → acceptance criteria → launch readiness
- Guardrails for correctness: idempotency, validation, dedupe
- Hands-on validation/troubleshooting: Postman + SQL

**Proof artifact**
- **DesktopTileLauncher** — a lightweight Windows desktop launcher I built as a sandbox for AI-assisted development + release discipline (CI/tests, tagged releases, security tooling).

**What I’m looking for**
- Senior PM roles: Platform / APIs / Integrations (Series A/B–Growth)
- Open to remote; Dallas/Plano hybrid also works
